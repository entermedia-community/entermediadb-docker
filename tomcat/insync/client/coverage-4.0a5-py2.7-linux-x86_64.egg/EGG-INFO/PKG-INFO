Description: Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses
        the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard
        library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.
        
        Coverage.py runs on CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5, PyPy 2.4, and PyPy3 2.4.

        tracker are on `Bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy>`_, with a
        mirrored repo on `GitHub <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>`_.
